# RegressionUsingRandomforest-VS-GradientBoost


Create custom regression models using the (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction) dataset and evaluate your model results. Split the dataset into training and test dataset 80:20.

 a) Create a Lasso regression, decision tree, Random forest, and GradientBoost models. Fit the model using the training dataset and find the model RMSE and R-Square. Explain each model's outcome, finding, and accuracy. 

 b) Predict the models using the test dataset, and provide the performance metrics. Compare the four models' performance metrics, and explain at least four findings on each of the models. Do not repeat the code to fit the model. 

 c) Do you see any bias and variance issues? How do you interpret each model output?

d) Write a function to find important features in each model? Why is it an important feature of the model? Explain with some statistical evidence.
